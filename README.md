# News Web Application

## Description

A fully functional website that allows users to post articles they find intriguing, while also being able to comment on other user's posts.

This website makes use of features such as user authentication, CRUD utility for articles and comments, while also following RESTful notation.

The stack for the webpage used is Node.JS, Express and MongoDB

## Motivation

After developing my experience in back-end web development, I decided to use my knowledge in this field, along with my knowledge in front-end web development, to develop a site that allows users to interact with each other, much like many professional social media platforms, which we see everyday.
